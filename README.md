# File Store
A simple website where users can upload images and PDFs that get saved in a folder called "uploads" and displayed in the main page.

**Link to project:** (wip)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

I used PHP to handle all the back-end work, which includes tasks like checking if a file has been uploaded, moving the uploaded file from its temporary directory in a directory inside the project called "uploads", and according to the file type, it is then displayed. In the main page, all the contents of "uploads" directory are displayed using a loop in PHP in a chronological order, newest to oldest. The styling of the website is done with CSS. I have used JavaScript to display the name of the file if the user  selects one, and if the user has deselects one, the appropriate message appears. If the user changes the selected file, the title also updates.

## Optimizations
I would have added the option to the user to upload more than one file at a time and I also would have implemented the ability to upload more file types, like simple text, video or audio. Besides that, I also wanted to change the styling of the website to make it more appealing.

## Lessons Learned:

I challenged my self to use PHP to do the back-end part of the site and I managed to do what I had in mind.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
